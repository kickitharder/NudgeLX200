Nudge LX200 Guider Driver
-------------------------

For 32-bit applications, programs and apps.  Works with PHD2.

This driver allows an application to send timed pulses to the Meade LX200 SCT telescope to nudge its mount in north, east, south and west direction to aid guiding and hence enhance imaging by removing star trailing.

This driver can work stand alone or alongside Keith Rickard's Meade LX200 Classic ASCOM driver. The drivers allow each other to access the LX200 serial port simultaneously.

Enjoy!
